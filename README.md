# The Friendship Cure

Loneliness is more dangerous than smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and more closely linked to our mortality than obesity. This app is a space for people to connect. By allowing the user to filter possible friendship connections, they are able to find friends in their area who share similar interests. The appâ€™s friend requesting, messaging and chatting features will increase the likelihood for newly-found friends to meet and connect.
